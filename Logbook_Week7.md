Meeting (Date: [Meeting Date])

**Present**: Cheng Marceline (CM, student), Pain Christopher (PC, supervisor), Li Yueyan (LY), Joshi Aniket C (AC)

**Key points discussed**:
- CM presented her comprehensive 4-part workflow for bird animation project: skeleton mapping, video generation, feature preservation, and temporal consistency.
- Progress update on Part 1 (skeleton detection): Successfully established 17-point skeleton system by combining CUB-201 bird dataset with AP10K multi-species dataset.
- CM demonstrated current results using HRNet for pose detection, showing successful skeleton detection on bird images with eyes, beak, neck, wings, legs, and tail.
- Technical implementation discussion: CM explained her pipeline using HRNet for pose detection, followed by planned Motion Diffusion Model and AnimateDiffusion + ControlNet for video generation.
- CM showed preliminary video generation results using ControlNet with Canny Edge detection, demonstrating consistent bird appearance but with limited movement capabilities.

**Feedback received**:
- LY confirmed CM's approach aligns with standard animation generation models using two-stage process (image-to-image then temporal smoothing).
- PC clarified that diffusion models are not mandatory for the project, though CM chose to continue with them for compatibility with Zeki's related work.
- LY suggested testing the model by using motion poses from one bird with reference images from another bird.
- AC requested video demonstration to better understand the current results.
  
**Challenges identified**:
- Dataset integration issues: CUB dataset originally had 15 points, required adding dummy points to reach 17; bird-specific skeleton structure doesn't fully map to mammal skeletons.
- Motion limitations: Current generated movements are too restricted (only head turning and slight body movement).
- Technical setup: Spent 1.5 days resolving environment issues; attempted Stable Diffusion XL upgrade but reverted to original ControlNet system.
  
**Work plan before next meeting**:
- Complete Parts 1-2 of the workflow by next week.
- Continue debugging and refinement of the pose detection and motion generation pipeline.
- Address motion limitation issues to enable more dynamic mammal-like movements.
- Share video demonstration via email to team members.
- Prepare for integration with Zeki's texture modification work as future input source.
